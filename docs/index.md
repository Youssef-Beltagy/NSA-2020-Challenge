# NSA Codebreaker Challenge 2020

In here, I solve NSA's [Codebreaker Challenge](https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/challenge).

## Task 1

Once you download the zip file and unzip it, you get the home directory. In the home directory, I got a folder named "AugustinePegas164". This folder is named after the username.

I looked through the files in the home directory. There is only one binary file, "keyfile". That must be the answer.
